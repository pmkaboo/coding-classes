#^ 1. Rails

# Ruby on Rails is a framework built in ruby that
# makes it easy and fast to build web applications.

# To get started with a plain we application, we
# need to go through just 4 steps:

#* `gem install rails`

# Rails is packaged as a gem for ruby, so we
# can install it like any other gem

#* `rails new app_name`

# This command will create a new rails app
# called AppName. It will generate the whole
# folder structure of the application and
# a number of files needed to run it.

#* bundle install

# In rails we have a file called Gemfile
# where we list all the gems that our
# application depends on, and this command
# will install all of them. Rails has some
# dependencies set up by default and we
# can add some more later when needed.

#* rails server

# This will start a rails server in
# the development environment and we can
# view it in the browser by navigating to
# http://localhost:3000.

#~ exercise:
# -> create a new rails app called Blog
# -> install all the dependencies
# -> run the server and confirm it's working

# -> in future exercises we will be making
#    changes to this same app, so optionally
#    you can also create a new git repo for
#    this app
